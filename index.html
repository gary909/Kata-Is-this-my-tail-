    <h1>Kata: Is this my tail?</h1>
    <p>
        Some new animals have arrived at the zoo. The zoo keeper is concerned that perhaps <br>
        the animals do not have the right tails. To help her, you must correct the broken <br>
        function to make sure that the second argument (tail), is the same as the last letter<br>
        of the first argument (body) - otherwise the tail wouldn't fit!<br>
<br>
        If the tail is right return true, else return false.<br>
<br>
        The arguments will always be strings, and normal letters.<br>
<br>
        For Haskell, body has the type of String and tail has the type of Char. For Go, body <br>
        has type string and tail has type rune.<br>
